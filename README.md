FreshFuture: An AI platform for predictive stocking, dynamic pricing and smart¬†donations.
## üåç Problem
The retail grocery sector faces a **massive food waste challenge**. Each year, billions of dollars worth of perishable goods are discarded due to **inaccurate demand forecasting** and **poor management of near-expiry inventory**.  
This leads to:
- Significant **financial losses** for retailers  
- **Environmental damage** from landfill waste  
- Increased **food insecurity** by discarding edible food

## üí° Solution
We built a **two-tier AI platform** to help retailers **reduce food waste**, **recover revenue**, and **promote sustainability**.

### **1. Strategic Forecasting (Long-Term)**

- Helps **prevent overstocking** and reduce future surplus.

### **2. Tactical Interventions (Real-Time)**
- Analyzes **daily inventory snapshots**:  
  stock-to-sales ratio + days until expiry.
- Predicts **sell-through rates** for perishable items.
- Recommends:
  - **Dynamic discounts** ‚Üí maximize revenue recovery.
  - **Smart donations** ‚Üí ensure edible food isn‚Äôt wasted.
- Tracks sustainability with metrics like **CO‚ÇÇ saved** and **revenue recovered**.
